                <p class="fs-5">
                    <strong>Global variables</strong> are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access,
                    such as a session id. <strong>A block variable</strong>, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is
                    declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost .

                <p class="fs-5">
                    <strong>The event loop</strong> is an architectural design pattern that allows code to run <strong>asynchronously</strong> on the javascript engines and
                    makes it possible for code to execute <strong>blocking instructions first</strong> and when available execute <strong>asynchronous functions</strong>. <strong>JavaScript</strong> has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and
                    processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like <strong>C</strong>
                    and <strong>Java</strong>.

                <h3>3.How many ways to get undefined?</h3>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is
                    assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
                    <img class="w-100 mt-2 mb-2" src="./images/example-1.png" alt="">
                    In the above example, we have not assigned any value to a variable named 'myVar'. A variable 'myVar' lacks a value. So
                    it is undefined.
                    You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. <br><br>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>undefined is a token. typeof undefined will return undefined not an object. <br> <br>
                    <img class="w-100 mt-2 mb-2" src="./images/example-2.png" alt="">
                    In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a
                    variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
                    
                    If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.
                    <img class="w-100 mt-2 mb-2" src="./images/example-3.png" alt="">
                    An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.
                    <img class="w-100 mt-2 mb-2" src="./images/example-4.png" alt="">
                    undefined is one of the main reasons to produce a runtime error in the JavaScript application. This happens if
                    you don't check the value of unknown return variables before using it. If you are not sure that a variable will always
                    have some value, the best practice is to check the value of variables for undefined before using them.
